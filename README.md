# Auto-Sell-All-Steam-Cards
Made a little script to sell all of my steam trading cards. I didn't care about them at all, and I can get real money for selling them?? Ok!

# All you need to do is run steamsellcards.py. 
If it doesn't work, make sure the images match up with your profile/username options. If they don't, just replace them and it should probably work. 
I whipped this together as a python refresher for myself, it's not as good as it could be.
